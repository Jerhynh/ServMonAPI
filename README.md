# ServMonAPI

ServMonAPI is an easy to use API that allows you to quickly and easily monitor windows hardware components via WMI.

Currently, the API supports monitoring of the following hardware components:
- Central Processing Units (CPUs)
- Video Cards (GPUs)
- Network Adapters (NICs)
- (More to come!)

The API has been tested and confirmed to work on Windows 10, Windows Server 2022, and windows 11, but should work on most other Windows Operating Systems that have a WMI interface available.

The test utility displays a potential use for a network-based billing application that calculates a bill amount based on the amount of data transferred.
